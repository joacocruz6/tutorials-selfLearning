# Pull Requests
Sometimes we want to suggest changes to the original repo when a fork is made.
For notify my changes to the origin repo, we made a pull request in the pull request branch. You can make conversations with that person and verify if the changes are good or bad, we can accept the request or throw it away.
That's its the course.
