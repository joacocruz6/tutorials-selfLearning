# Forks
Sometimes we want copies of some repo in github but not be a master branch.
If we want to have that repo on my project, we click on the fork button on github.
This make that the changes we make to the repo are made in our own repo and not the original one.
We don't want to change the original if everybody are using it!

Then we do the git clone in our PC and done! Also all the pushes made by our repo, is going to be uploaded to the repo we have on the github, not the original own.
