# Introduccion
Git was created by Linus Torvalds (Linux Creator).
## Pros
It is a software for control of versions. It gives us some control over our projects (we can determinate who made what changes), also some controls of changes over time and the use of tags for versioning.

The mayor pro is that give us a much easier work when we are in a team.
## Cons

1. The learning curve is difficult.
2. Some files are very difficult to handle

## Some clarifications
1. Git != GitHub, Git is the system but GitHub (or Bitbucket or GitLab) are a social network for sharing our proyects.

## Disclaimer
I will skip the second video. I work in Linux so it has pre-installed Git. Also, the $ in the bash is the $ of the bash so you don't have to put it in your bash, you just type the commands next to it.
