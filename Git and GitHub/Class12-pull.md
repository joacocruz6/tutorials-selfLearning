# Git pull command
If changes are made in GitHub but not in our local repository, we want to have those changes on my computer?

They exists two command, fetch and pull. Fetch creates a new branch with the changes, and pull integrates them directly to our current branch.

We simply do:
```bash
$ git pull
```
And download the changes.

## Blame
If we want to see the changes in GitHub of who made what changes, we simply click on the blame button. It will show us how the file was being constructed over time.
