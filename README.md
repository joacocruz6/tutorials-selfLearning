# Self Learning Archives
Here will be my notes for my self learning processes. They will be all made by markdown archives and they are parts from free videos on youtube.

I already know languages, the more I am used to are Java (main one), Python, C, PHP, HTML, SQL.
But I know the basics of JavaScript,C++ and Git and GitHub.

First I wanna do its get more knowledge of versioning.
Then are courses of getting the hang of the languages that I am not very good at (JS and C++) and then I will start doing new languages and frameworks. The C++ will be just POO and the first classes (stdin and stdout of data).

The playlist of the videos will be pointed here and if someone will read my notes, they will be on english with code inside.
(There will be a ticket when I complete the course and the notes are available)

A little disclaimer, I am doing this for fun, because I love programming and coding, I need to keep learning languages  and make versioning of it, so why not sharing my notes to the world!. If someone of the community want to check my notes, that's no problem for me, and if you want to correct some things, that's ok too! Just let me know!.
I wanna give a special thanks to the Platzi company, their videos encourage me to keep learning, however I can't pay their courses, but I will give them a try in a near future.
