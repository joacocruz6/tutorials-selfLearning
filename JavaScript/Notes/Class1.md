# Introduction
## Recomendation
Watch the HTML and CSS tutorial or my notes when they are ready before this.
JavaScript (JS for short) is fundamental to the web browsers.
## Disclaimers
First of all, this section is just for JS, nothing more. There will be notes
for it's frameworks but this is initial and fundamental of JS.

Also, it's highly remarkable that Java is NOT JavaScript.

## Content in Websites
A website is displayed in three layers of information:
- Content layer: Is the most 'external' layer of the website, it purely HTML
- Presentation layer: CSS applied to HTML to make website look prettier
- Interactive layer: Tha JavaScript layer that change what we do in the website

The most remarkable difference between them is that CSS and HTML are just loaded, but
JS keeps running along side the website when it's loaded on the navigator. We can make
changes to our website without loading the whole page again.

## Resources
We need an editor and a browser.
I will use Atom, but I recommend Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code which are nice for code editors.
Mozilla Firefox or Chrome is good browsers to get hand of it.

#### Extensions to use
To install extensions, we need packages. To get more packages go:
File->Settings->Install
and to make it works we do:
CTRL+SHIFT+p
And search it to use it.

The first package to install is atom-beautify, when you install the extension, you need to restart the editor to make it work.
The second extension is atom-live-server, which allows us to refresh every time we safe the document automatically.
