# The BOM and DOM
The BOM is the browser object model, this is the manipulation of our browser through objects. To use the browser we use the object (global):
```JavaScript
window
```
Now to refer to our web page we use the DOM, this is the document object model. The global variable using the DOM is the document. So every manipulation we use document object to manipulate the dom.

## Representation of HTML
HTML is representated by a tree, this a nested struct of our website and the base of everything.
