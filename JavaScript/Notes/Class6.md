# Rules in JavaScript
We end all lines with semicolon (;)

The coments are written like:
```JavaScript
/*
Multi-line comment
*/
//One line comment
```

JavaScript is case sensitive, this is that variables like:
```JavaScript
var Name="Hello";
alert(name);
```
will throw error because name is not defined, Name is the one that we defined.

## Some syntax agreements

Coders in JavaScript have some syntax agreements for variables names,
this is for composite names (more than one word for names), that is the second word start
with a Cap letter.

Also, constant variable names are in all caps.
