#Functions in Ruby!
Finally we are hitting the functions on ruby. So the structure of a function is the SAME as Python, it is:
```Ruby
def functionName(arguments)
  #code
end
$end
```
The function is defined by the def and the end, that end is ending the function and not the script!. If there are no arguments on the function, then the () brackets can be deleted.
## Example
In example, this function prints a quote from Carl Sagan
```Ruby
def sagan
  puts "Somewhere something incredible is waiting to be known"
end
$end
```
To execute it we do:
```Ruby
sagan
$end
```
