# Input from the users in ruby
So to get input from the users we have a method that is gets and chomp.
To write this on a simple script we do:
```Ruby
print "Please type your first name: "
user_input = gets.chomp
puts "Your first name is #(user_input)!"
$end
```
Then this will receive the name of the user. Now we can interact to the user using the gets.chomp method!
