# Class 1 Intro to Ruby
The ruby programs are in .rb types of files. The guy of the tutorial use komodo IDE to make the programs.

### Variables and all that stuff
So the first thing to learn is to print and puts.

A simple program will be:
```Ruby
print "This is my first ruby lesson."
```
And when we execute it, it will appear on console: This is my first ruby lesson.
If we now type
```Ruby
print "This is my first ruby lesson."
puts "This is my second line."
print "This is my gun."
puts "My gun is my only friend."
puts "I need more friends :C."
```
So whats it's the difference. Print doesn't get to a new line, we have to specified with the character \\n. But if we use puts, every puts is in a new line.
##### Now Variables
To declare variables in ruby, is just equal like in Python.
For example:
```Ruby
my_cat = "Cute"
print my_cat
```
And the string Cute will be printed, because it is on the variable my_cat.

###### Executing ruby on bash
First of all install ruby on your bash, to verify installation we do:
```bash
$ ruby -ver
```
To see the ruby version of it.
Then we type:
```bash
$ ruby fileToExecute.rb
```
